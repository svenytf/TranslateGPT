# TranslateGPT

## Introduction

This is my 2nd SvelteKit project, and it's using the OpenAI endpoints to translate, because from my experience, there is NOTHING that can translate better than OpenAI's LLMs.
This project VERY WIP, as I learn SvelteKit, and Typescript, especially handling streams and stuff. Please excuse the mess.

- Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/svenytf/TranslateGPT
```
